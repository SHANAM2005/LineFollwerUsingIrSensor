# LineFollwerUsingIrSensor
This code controls bot to follower black line over white surface. I have tried to make it as efficient as possible without using analog ir array and PID algo. I have tried to tackle dead ends, loops and dashed lines.

I have setup 6 digital ir sensors in front, 4 in straight line and 2 extreme most are slightly behind them.
